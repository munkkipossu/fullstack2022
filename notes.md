# Notes


## Part0
Read lectures, all pretty clear. Gotta find time for the exercises.


### HTML
Attribute [reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes)


### CSS
- [selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)
- [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)
- [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements)


## Part1

A lot of things to keep track of: javasript vs react, react versions, firefox vs chrome (how do their dev environments differ?)

The way libraries in javascript (eg. React, JSX) modify the syntax of the language is **really** weird. 
It almost seems as though using React is different from using javascript, just the underlying engine is the same.


### Javascript

`let` seems to be important for closures, otherwise `var` can be used (global vs "block" scope)

object inheritance through prototyping is a little weird, gotta read about that some more

learning about `classes` and `this` (and old react?) might be useful at some later point, but not necessary for now
NOTE - classes are not first true constructs of the language -> so how does `this` work


### React

look at function syntax at some point, the simplified syntax for "one liners" seems easy to misuse
