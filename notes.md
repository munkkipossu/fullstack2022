A lot of things to keep track of: javasript vs react, 

`let` seems to be important for closures, otherwise `var` can be used (global vs "block" scope)

The way libraries in javascript (eg. React, JSX) modify the syntax of the language is **really** weird. It almost seems as though using React is different from using javascript, just the underlying engine is the same.
